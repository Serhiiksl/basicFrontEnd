 Need for Speed Heat (stylised as NFS Heat) is a
 2019 racing video game developed by Ghost Games and published 
 by Electronic Arts for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It is 
 the twenty-fourth instalment in the Need for Speed series and commemorates the 
 series' 25th anniversary. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who mostly
  found the game to be an improvement over the 2015 Need for Speed reboot and Payback but
   not enough to be a full return to form for the franchise.

 Heat was Ghost Games' final game both for the Need for Speed
 franchise and as a lead developer. In February 2020, EA shifted development of 
 the franchise back to Criterion Games—the developers of the Burnout series, Need for Speed:
  Hot Pursuit (2010) and Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012)—and reduced Ghost Games 
  to an engineering studio for the Frostbite engine, reverting their name back to EA Gothenburg. 
  The game is succeeded by Need for Speed Unbound, which released in December 2022.

 Need for Speed Heat is a racing game set in an open world
  environment called Palm City, a fictionalised version of Miami, Florida, 
  and its surrounding areas. The in-game map features diverse geography, including 
  mountainous areas, dense forests, and open fields.[1] Unlike Need for Speed Payback, the game
   does not include a 24-hour day-night cycle, but players can switch between day and night. During
    the day, players can take part in sanctioned race events, which reward players with cash to spend
     on new cars and upgrades. During the night, players can take part in illicit street racing, which 
     rewards REP. Racing during the night will attract the attention of a rogue police task force that
      patrols the streets of Palm City, who are tasked with shutting down street racing in Palm City,
       which can lead players to risk their earned rep against the police or lose their earnings in 
       handcuffs. Pursuits in Palm City can take place during day or night, but the PCPD's response to
        a pursuit differs depending on the time period. Players earn rep from participating in pursuits,
         with great amounts offered during night than day. Each heat level also equates to the amount a
          player's earned rep for a current night session will be multiplied by, should they successfully 
          reach a safehouse or garage.
